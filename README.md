# Password-Assignment
I am to create a random password generator with JS

In this assignment, I created my own code and then consulted other examples of code to incorporate elements into my own. 

The program initiates after the generate button is clicked. After the button is clicked, the user is prompted with a character count value. Then the user is prompted and must confirm to include the following elements which include special, numeric, uppercase, and lowercase characters.

Once all prompts are answered, the random password appears in the text box. If the password exceeds the textbox size, it is expandable and collapsilbe.

The password generator then restarts if the button is clicked again.
